Spam Detection ML Project using Google Colab
Welcome to the Spam Detection ML Project using Google Colab! This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Leveraging Google Colab's powerful cloud-based infrastructure, we can easily train and evaluate machine learning models on large datasets without worrying about hardware limitations.

The Spam Detection ML Project includes various steps such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. We'll utilize popular NLP libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and scikit-learn for text processing and model building. Additionally, we'll leverage Google Colab's integration with Google Drive for seamless data loading and saving.

To get started, open the provided Google Colab notebook in your browser. Ensure you have a Google account and access to Google Drive for saving and loading datasets. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, extract features from the text, train machine learning models (such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, or Neural Networks), and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The Spam Detection ML Project is designed to be educational and practical, providing hands-on experience with building and deploying machine learning models for text classification tasks. By leveraging the power of Google Colab, you can efficiently experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques to improve model performance.

Contributions are welcome! Whether you're interested in optimizing the notebook's code, adding support for new datasets, or implementing advanced machine learning techniques, we encourage you to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
